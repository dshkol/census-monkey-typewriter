# Workflow Meta-Learnings & Continuous Improvement

*Last updated: 2025-06-26*  
*Sessions covered: 4*

## Quick Reference - Current Best Practices

### Analysis Development
- **NEVER use simulated data**: Always use real Census data - simulated data invalidates entire analysis
- **Direct geometry retrieval**: Use `get_acs(geometry = TRUE, resolution = "20m", cb = TRUE) %>% shift_geometry()`
- **Parallel sub-agent execution**: Use Task tool for simultaneous analysis of multiple hypotheses  
- **Always start with .R script** → debug & iterate → transfer to .Rmd when stable
- **Default to national scale**: Don't artificially limit geographic scope unless computational constraints require it
- **Library dependency verification**: Always include `library(tigris)` when using `shift_geometry()`

### Statistical Standards
- **Advanced multivariate methods**: Use Mahalanobis distance, DTW, GAM modeling for sophisticated analysis
- **Cross-disciplinary techniques**: Adapt computer science/ML methods for demographic analysis
- **National scale optimization**: Implement stratified sampling and chunked processing for large datasets
- **Report effect sizes**: Not just significance—quantify practical importance
- **Geographic controls**: Include state/regional analysis for context
- **Honest null reporting**: Contradicted/null findings equally valuable scientifically

### Documentation Quality  
- **Meaningful titles**: Focus on insights, not descriptions ("Employment Drives Independence" not "Unemployment vs Basement Dwelling")
- **Remove redundant labels**: Never label as "Real Census data" - all data should be real
- **Manage overplotting**: Use alpha transparency and smaller points for large datasets (3000+ points)
- **Executive summary first**: Lead with key findings and policy implications
- **Professional choropleth**: Always use `shift_geometry()` for U.S. maps, specify resolution appropriately

### Project Management
- **Real-time todo tracking**: Update TodoWrite throughout, not in batches
- **Logical git commits**: Group by analysis type (R scripts, supported, contradicted)
- **Clear file naming**: Avoid confusion between hypothesis files
- **Scope management**: Deep analysis of fewer hypotheses > shallow coverage of many

### 2025-06-26: Basement Dweller Analysis Deep Dive (Earlier Session)
**Scope**: Single hypothesis deep methodology improvement, real data vs simulated data crisis, spatial best practices  
**Duration**: Extended session focused on data integrity and visualization quality  
**Outcome**: Corrected analysis using real Census data, improved spatial methodology, professional visualization standards

#### Critical Data Integrity Learning
**The Mortal Sin of Simulated Data**
- User identified critical error: creating simulated/demo data to complete analysis instead of using real Census data
- Fundamental violation of data integrity principles - simulated data undermines entire analytical framework
- **Never create fake data to complete an analysis** - this invalidates all findings and policy recommendations
- Real data discovery led to hypothesis contradiction: unemployment (R² = 0.178), not housing costs (R² = 0.052), drives basement dwelling
- Lesson: Real data often contradicts intuitive assumptions - this is scientifically valuable, not problematic

#### Spatial Data Best Practices Revolution
**Direct Geometry Retrieval**
- **Critical insight**: Use `get_acs(geometry = TRUE, resolution = "20m")` instead of separate spatial joins
- Much more efficient than getting data separately then joining with `tigris::states()` or `counties()`
- Follows tidycensus book best practices and eliminates potential join errors
- Example transformation: `get_acs(geography = "county", geometry = TRUE, resolution = "20m") %>% shift_geometry()`

**Professional Choropleth Standards**
- **Always use `tigris::shift_geometry()`** for U.S. maps to position Alaska and Hawaii properly
- **Specify appropriate resolution**: `"20m"` for national maps, higher resolution for local analysis
- **Scale constraints fixed**: Use `trans = "sqrt"` and custom breaks for better color distribution
- **Larger figure dimensions**: `fig.width=12, fig.height=8` for national choropleth maps

#### Visualization Excellence for Large Datasets
**Managing Overplotting Effectively**
- **Remove error bars** when plotting hundreds or thousands of points - they create visual clutter
- **Alpha transparency** (0.4-0.6) essential for large scatterplots to show density patterns
- **Smaller point sizes** (1.5 instead of 3-4) work better with many data points
- **Example**: 3,215 county scatterplot requires `alpha = 0.6, size = 1.5` not `size = 4` with error bars

**Meaningful Titles Over Descriptive Labels**
- **Focus on insights, not descriptions**: "Employment Opportunities Drive Young Adult Independence" vs "Unemployment vs Basement Dwelling Rates"
- **Remove redundant labeling**: Never label as "Real Census data" - all data should be real
- **Titles should reflect the takeaway**: What does the reader need to understand from this visualization?
- **Programmatic limitations**: Sometimes good titles require understanding the specific analytical insight

#### National Scale Analysis Capabilities
**API Performance with Large Datasets**
- **National county retrieval works well**: 3,215 counties retrieved in ~5 seconds with geometry
- **Resolution parameter crucial**: "20m" enables fast download while maintaining adequate detail
- **No need to limit to states**: National analysis provides much richer geographic patterns
- **Memory management**: Large sf objects require consideration but modern systems handle well
