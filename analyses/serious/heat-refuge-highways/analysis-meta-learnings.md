# Analysis Meta-Learnings: Heat Refuge Highways

## What Worked Well

### **Geospatial Framework Development**
- **Temperature Proxy Creation**: Latitude-based heat index (50 - latitude) produced geographically sensible climate zones matching known U.S. patterns
- **Spatial Data Integration**: Seamless combination of tidycensus demographic data with sf spatial objects enabled efficient choropleth mapping
- **County Centroid Extraction**: Successfully calculated centroids for 3,076 counties using st_centroid() and coordinate extraction
- **Scale Management**: Framework handled full continental U.S. dataset efficiently, proving national-level analysis is computationally feasible

### **Data Processing Approaches**
- **State FIPS Filtering**: Systematic exclusion of Alaska, Hawaii, and territories using state FIPS codes created clean continental U.S. sample
- **Population Thresholding**: Filtering counties with population > 1,000 removed statistical noise from tiny counties
- **Categorical Classification**: Five-tier climate zone system (Cool North to Hot South) provided meaningful geographic groupings
- **Coordinate System Management**: Proper WGS84 projection (EPSG:4326) ensured accurate latitude/longitude calculations

### **Visualization Excellence**
- **Viridis Color Scales**: Professional plasma palette clearly communicated temperature gradients with accessibility compliance
- **Choropleth Standards**: Clean county boundary mapping with white borders and appropriate sizing (0.1) for national-scale visualization
- **Heat Stress Classification**: Manual color scheme (red/orange/blue) intuitively communicated climate risk levels
- **Professional Theming**: Minimal theme with clear titles, subtitles, and legends established publication-ready standards

### **Research Adaptability**
- **Hypothesis Pivot Strategy**: When migration flows proved unavailable, successfully pivoted to methodology validation and framework establishment
- **Infrastructure Focus**: Emphasis on reproducible framework creation provides foundation for future research with better data
- **Documentation Standards**: Comprehensive R Markdown with clear methodology section enables replication and extension

## What Didn't Work

### **Critical Data Availability Issues**
- **Migration Flows API Failure**: get_flows() returned empty results for all 8 high-heat counties tested, preventing core hypothesis testing
- **API Rate Limiting Concerns**: Multiple sequential get_flows() calls created potential bottleneck without clear error messaging
- **Data Structure Uncertainty**: Unclear whether flows data failure was due to API limits, data availability, or geographic scope limitations
- **No Fallback Data Strategy**: Lacked alternative migration data sources when primary approach failed

### **Temperature Proxy Limitations**
- **Oversimplified Climate Model**: Latitude-only proxy ignores critical factors:
  - Elevation effects (mountains vs. valleys)
  - Urban heat island effects
  - Proximity to large water bodies (moderating effect)
  - Humidity differences (heat index vs. temperature)
  - Seasonal variation patterns
- **Regional Climate Complexities**: Pacific Northwest coastal areas misclassified due to maritime climate moderation
- **Desert vs. Humidity**: Southwestern desert heat differs qualitatively from southeastern humid heat

### **Methodological Gaps**
- **No Validation Against Actual Temperature**: Never compared latitude proxy against NOAA temperature station data or climate normals
- **Missing Economic Controls**: No consideration of economic opportunity differentials that drive migration independent of climate
- **Temporal Snapshot Limitation**: Single-year demographic data can't reveal migration trends or climate adaptation patterns
- **Causality Framework Absent**: No theoretical framework for distinguishing climate-driven vs. economically-driven migration

### **Technical Implementation Issues**
- **Error Handling Insufficient**: get_flows() failures not caught gracefully, leading to analysis breakdown rather than informative error messages
- **Memory Management**: Large spatial datasets (3,076 counties with geometry) not optimized for memory efficiency
- **Coordinate Transformation**: Multiple projection transforms (WGS84, then dropping geometry) potentially inefficient

## Technical Lessons

### **Successful Spatial Data Patterns**
```r
# Effective county centroid calculation
counties_centroids <- counties_sf %>%
  st_transform(4326) %>%  # Ensure WGS84
  mutate(
    centroid = st_centroid(geometry),
    latitude = st_coordinates(centroid)[,2],
    longitude = st_coordinates(centroid)[,1]
  ) %>%
  st_drop_geometry()  # Drop geometry for efficiency after extraction
```

### **Migration Flows API Limitations Discovered**
```r
# get_flows() usage pattern that failed
flows <- get_flows(
  geography = "county",
  state = str_sub(county_geoid, 1, 2),
  county = str_sub(county_geoid, 3, 5),
  year = 2022,
  output = "wide"
)
# Result: Empty dataframes for all tested counties
# Lesson: Always test single API call before implementing loops
```

### **Effective Temperature Proxy Framework**
- **Heat Index Formula**: 50 - latitude provides intuitive scale where higher numbers = hotter climates
- **Categorical Thresholds**: Latitude breaks at 30째, 35째, 40째, 45째 align with natural climate zones
- **Heat Stress Simplification**: Three-category system (High/Moderate/Low Heat) more interpretable than five categories
- **Geographic Validation**: Visual map inspection confirms proxy produces expected north-south gradients

### **Choropleth Mapping Best Practices**
- **Color Scale Selection**: viridis "plasma" option most effective for temperature visualization
- **Border Styling**: White borders with size = 0.1 optimal for county-level national maps  
- **Legend Positioning**: Bottom placement works best for wide national maps
- **Title Hierarchy**: Clear title/subtitle/caption structure improves comprehension

## Methodological Insights

### **Geospatial Framework Validation**

- **Data Integration Success**: tidycensus + sf + ggplot2 workflow provides robust foundation for demographic geography research
- **Visual Communication**: Professional choropleth maps effectively communicate geographic patterns to both academic and policy audiences
- **Reproducible Standards**: Framework documentation enables replication across different geographic contexts

### **Climate Migration Research Challenges**
- **Data Availability Critical**: Migration flows data availability more limited than anticipated, requiring alternative data strategies
- **Proxy Validation Essential**: Temperature proxies require validation against actual climate data before drawing conclusions

- **Temporal Dimension**: Single-year snapshots insufficient for understanding migration patterns and trends

### **Policy Framework Applications**
- **Origin Zone Identification**: Systematic identification of 112 high-heat counties provides actionable geographic targeting for climate adaptation
- **Visualization Impact**: Professional maps communicate climate vulnerability more effectively than statistical tables
- **Infrastructure Planning**: County-level analysis appropriate scale for transportation, housing, and service planning
- **Research Foundation**: Framework provides baseline for longitudinal climate migration monitoring
