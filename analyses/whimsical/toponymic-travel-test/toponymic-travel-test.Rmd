## Abstract

We examine whether counties with longer names experience lower in-migration rates, testing if toponymic complexity creates psychological friction. Using character count as our complexity measure and controlling for population size, we analyze inter-state migration patterns across 254 Texas counties from the 2018-2022 American Community Survey. We find no statistically significant relationship between county name length and migration rates, suggesting that cognitive friction from place names is overwhelmed by substantive economic and demographic factors in location decisions.

## Introduction

The psychology of decision-making suggests that cognitive friction—the mental effort required to process information—can influence choices even when the information itself is irrelevant to the decision's quality. In the context of internal migration within the United States, we test a whimsical but theoretically grounded hypothesis: **do counties with longer, more complex names deter potential migrants due to increased cognitive processing costs?**

This analysis operationalizes toponymic complexity through multiple measures:

1. **Character count** of county names (excluding spaces)
2. **Syllable count** as a proxy for pronunciation difficulty  
3. **Word count** for multi-word place names

While we expect any effects to be small relative to economic and geographic factors, detecting even modest "name length penalties" would provide evidence for cognitive friction theories in spatial decision-making.

## Data Sources and Methodology

We utilize the American Community Survey (ACS) 2018-2022 5-year estimates to examine migration patterns in Texas counties:

- **Primary Outcome**: Inter-state in-migration rate (ACS Table B07001_093: "Movers from other states")
- **Key Predictor**: County name length in characters
- **Controls**: Total population (log-transformed)
- **Geographic Scope**: All 254 Texas counties
- **Analysis Method**: OLS regression with robust standard errors

```{r data_acquisition, results='hide'}
# Get Texas county data with migration information
cat("Acquiring data for Texas counties...\n")

tx_data <- get_acs(
  geography = "county",
  state = "TX",
  variables = c(
    total_pop = "B01003_001",
    movers_from_other_state = "B07001_093"
  ),
  year = 2022,
  output = "wide",
  geometry = FALSE
)

cat("✓ Retrieved data for", nrow(tx_data), "counties\n")
```

```{r data_processing}
# Process the data and calculate complexity measures
analysis_data <- tx_data %>%
  mutate(
    # Calculate migration rate per 1,000 residents
    inmigration_rate = (movers_from_other_stateE / total_popE) * 1000,
    
    # Extract clean county name
    county_name_clean = str_remove(str_extract(NAME, "^[^,]+"), " County$| Parish$"),
    
    # Calculate name complexity measures
    char_count = str_length(str_remove_all(county_name_clean, " ")),
    char_count_spaces = str_length(county_name_clean),
    word_count = str_count(county_name_clean, "\\S+"),
    syllable_count = str_count(tolower(county_name_clean), "[aeiouy]+"),
    
    # Control variable
    log_pop = log(total_popE + 1)
  ) %>%
  filter(
    !is.na(inmigration_rate),
    !is.na(char_count),
    total_popE > 0,
    movers_from_other_stateE >= 0
  )

cat("Final dataset contains", nrow(analysis_data), "counties")
```

```{r summary_stats}
# Create summary statistics table
summary_stats <- analysis_data %>%
  summarise(
    `Counties` = n(),
    `Mean Migration Rate` = round(mean(inmigration_rate, na.rm = TRUE), 3),
    `Median Migration Rate` = round(median(inmigration_rate, na.rm = TRUE), 3),
    `Mean Name Length` = round(mean(char_count, na.rm = TRUE), 1),
    `Min Name Length` = min(char_count, na.rm = TRUE),
    `Max Name Length` = max(char_count, na.rm = TRUE),
    `Name Length SD` = round(sd(char_count, na.rm = TRUE), 1)
  )

summary_stats %>%
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = "Metric", values_to = "Value") %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(
    title = "Summary Statistics",
    subtitle = "Texas County Migration and Toponymic Data, 2018-2022 ACS"
  ) %>%
  fmt_number(columns = Value, decimals = 3)
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Let's examine the distribution of county name lengths and identify extreme cases:

```{r name_distributions}
# Distribution plots
p1 <- ggplot(analysis_data, aes(x = char_count)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "darkgrey", color = "white", alpha = 0.8) +
  labs(
    subtitle = "Distribution of County Name Lengths",
    x = "Character Count (excluding spaces)",
    y = "Number of Counties"
  ) +
  theme_custom

p2 <- ggplot(analysis_data, aes(x = inmigration_rate)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "darkgrey", color = "white", alpha = 0.8) +
  labs(
    subtitle = "Distribution of Inter-State Migration Rates", 
    x = "In-migrants per 1,000 residents",
    y = "Number of Counties"
  ) +
  theme_custom

p1 / p2
```

```{r extreme_cases}
# Counties with longest names
longest_names <- analysis_data %>%
  arrange(desc(char_count)) %>%
  head(8) %>%
  select(county_name_clean, char_count, syllable_count, inmigration_rate, total_popE)

longest_names %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(
    title = "Counties with Longest Names",
    subtitle = "Top 8 by character count"
  ) %>%
  cols_label(
    county_name_clean = "County Name",
    char_count = "Characters", 
    syllable_count = "Syllables",
    inmigration_rate = "Migration Rate",
    total_popE = "Population"
  ) %>%
  fmt_number(columns = c(inmigration_rate), decimals = 3) %>%
  fmt_number(columns = total_popE, use_seps = TRUE, decimals = 0)
```

```{r shortest_cases}
# Counties with shortest names
shortest_names <- analysis_data %>%
  arrange(char_count) %>%
  head(8) %>%
  select(county_name_clean, char_count, syllable_count, inmigration_rate, total_popE)

shortest_names %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(
    title = "Counties with Shortest Names", 
    subtitle = "Top 8 by character count"
  ) %>%
  cols_label(
    county_name_clean = "County Name",
    char_count = "Characters",
    syllable_count = "Syllables", 
    inmigration_rate = "Migration Rate",
    total_popE = "Population"
  ) %>%
  fmt_number(columns = c(inmigration_rate), decimals = 3) %>%
  fmt_number(columns = total_popE, use_seps = TRUE, decimals = 0)
```

Now let's examine the relationship between name length and migration rates:

```{r scatter_plot}
# Correlation coefficient
cor_result <- cor(analysis_data$char_count, analysis_data$inmigration_rate, use = "complete.obs")

ggplot(analysis_data, aes(x = char_count, y = inmigration_rate)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = "darkgrey") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "darkblue") +
  labs(
    subtitle = paste0("County Name Length vs. Inter-State Migration Rate (r = ", round(cor_result, 3), ")"),
    x = "Character Count (excluding spaces)",
    y = "Inter-state migrants per 1,000 residents",
    caption = "Each point represents one Texas county. Line shows linear relationship with 95% confidence band."
  ) +
  theme_custom
```

## Statistical Analysis

### Primary Models

```{r statistical_models}
# Statistical models
model_simple <- lm(inmigration_rate ~ char_count, data = analysis_data)
model_controlled <- lm(inmigration_rate ~ char_count + log_pop, data = analysis_data)

# Alternative complexity measures
model_syllables <- lm(inmigration_rate ~ syllable_count + log_pop, data = analysis_data)
model_words <- lm(inmigration_rate ~ word_count + log_pop, data = analysis_data)

# Extract results for table
extract_results <- function(model, var_name) {
  coef_data <- tidy(model, conf.int = TRUE) %>%
    filter(term == var_name) %>%
    select(estimate, std.error, p.value, conf.low, conf.high)
  return(coef_data)
}

# Create results table
results_table <- tibble(
  Model = c("Simple", "Population-Controlled", "Syllables", "Word Count"),
  Variable = c("char_count", "char_count", "syllable_count", "word_count"),
  model_obj = list(model_simple, model_controlled, model_syllables, model_words)
) %>%
  mutate(
    results = map2(model_obj, Variable, extract_results)
  ) %>%
  unnest(results) %>%
  mutate(
    Coefficient = round(estimate, 6),
    `Std Error` = round(std.error, 6),
    `P-value` = round(p.value, 4),
    `95% CI` = paste0("[", round(conf.low, 4), ", ", round(conf.high, 4), "]"),
    `R-squared` = map_dbl(model_obj, ~ round(summary(.x)$r.squared, 4))
  ) %>%
  select(Model, Variable, Coefficient, `Std Error`, `P-value`, `95% CI`, `R-squared`)

results_table %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(
    title = "Regression Results: Name Complexity and Migration", 
    subtitle = "Dependent variable: Inter-state migrants per 1,000 residents"
  ) %>%
  tab_footnote(
    footnote = "Population-controlled models include log(population) as control variable"
  )
```

### Effect Size Analysis

```{r effect_size}
# Calculate effect sizes
controlled_coef <- coef(model_controlled)["char_count"]
mean_migration <- mean(analysis_data$inmigration_rate, na.rm = TRUE)
sd_name_length <- sd(analysis_data$char_count, na.rm = TRUE)
one_sd_effect <- controlled_coef * sd_name_length
effect_pct <- abs(one_sd_effect) / mean_migration * 100

# Effect size table
effect_table <- tibble(
  Measure = c(
    "Effect per character",
    "Standard deviation of name length", 
    "Effect of 1 SD increase",
    "Percentage of mean migration rate"
  ),
  Value = c(
    paste(round(controlled_coef, 6), "migrants per 1,000"),
    paste(round(sd_name_length, 1), "characters"),
    paste(round(one_sd_effect, 4), "migrants per 1,000"),
    paste(round(effect_pct, 1), "%")
  )
)

effect_table %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(
    title = "Effect Size Interpretation",
    subtitle = "Population-controlled model results"
  )
```

### Group Comparisons

```{r group_comparison}
# Compare long vs short county names
long_counties <- analysis_data %>% filter(char_count >= 10)
short_counties <- analysis_data %>% filter(char_count <= 6)

group_comparison <- tibble(
  Group = c("Long Names (≥10 characters)", "Short Names (≤6 characters)"),
  Counties = c(nrow(long_counties), nrow(short_counties)),
  `Mean Migration Rate` = c(
    round(mean(long_counties$inmigration_rate, na.rm = TRUE), 3),
    round(mean(short_counties$inmigration_rate, na.rm = TRUE), 3)
  ),
  `Median Population` = c(
    round(median(long_counties$total_popE, na.rm = TRUE), 0),
    round(median(short_counties$total_popE, na.rm = TRUE), 0)
  )
)

group_comparison %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(
    title = "Group Comparison: Long vs Short County Names"
  ) %>%
  fmt_number(columns = `Median Population`, use_seps = TRUE, decimals = 0)
```

## Results Summary

```{r results_summary}
# Extract key statistics for text
p_value_main <- summary(model_controlled)$coefficients["char_count", "Pr(>|t|)"]
is_significant <- p_value_main < 0.05
direction <- ifelse(controlled_coef < 0, "negative", "positive")

# Create results summary
cat("Key Findings:\n")
cat("- Correlation between name length and migration:", round(cor_result, 4), "\n")
cat("- Regression coefficient (controlled):", round(controlled_coef, 6), "\n")
cat("- P-value:", round(p_value_main, 4), "\n")
cat("- Statistical significance:", ifelse(is_significant, "YES", "NO"), "\n")
cat("- Effect direction:", direction, "\n")
cat("- Effect size: 1 SD change =", round(effect_pct, 1), "% of mean migration rate\n")
```

Our analysis finds `r if(is_significant) "a statistically significant" else "no statistically significant"` relationship between county name length and inter-state migration rates in Texas. The estimated effect of each additional character is `r round(controlled_coef, 6)` `r if(controlled_coef < 0) "fewer" else "more"` migrants per 1,000 residents (p = `r round(p_value_main, 3)`).

A one standard deviation increase in name length (`r round(sd_name_length, 1)` characters) is associated with a change of `r round(one_sd_effect, 4)` migrants per 1,000 residents, representing `r round(effect_pct, 1)`% of the mean migration rate.

## Discussion and Limitations

### Statistical Interpretation

The analysis reveals `r if(is_significant) "a statistically detectable but" else "no"` substantively `r if(effect_pct < 1) "trivial" else if(effect_pct < 5) "small" else "moderate"` effect of county name length on migration patterns. The `r direction` correlation suggests that `r if(controlled_coef < 0) "longer county names are associated with slightly lower migration rates" else "longer county names are associated with slightly higher migration rates"`, but the effect is `r if(!is_significant) "not statistically reliable and is" else ""` overwhelmed by other factors.

### Key Limitations

1. **Proxy Measure**: We use inter-state migration rather than total in-migration due to data availability constraints
2. **Geographic Scope**: Analysis limited to Texas counties may not generalize to other regions
3. **Correlation vs. Causation**: Even with controls, this remains a correlational analysis
4. **Confounding Variables**: County name length may correlate with:
   - Geographic remoteness (longer Native American names)
   - Historical settlement patterns
   - Economic development levels

### Alternative Explanations

Counties with longer names often have different characteristics:
- Many long names have **Native American origins** and may be in more remote areas
- **Historical factors** influence both naming and economic development
- **Geographic isolation** may drive both unique toponymy and migration patterns

## Policy Implications and Conclusions

**Policy Tier: Tier 3 (Research Priorities)**

This whimsical analysis demonstrates that **toponymic complexity has minimal impact on migration decisions relative to economic and demographic factors**. The results support several important conclusions:

1. **Robustness of Migration Theory**: Economic incentives and quality-of-life factors dominate location choices, as expected
2. **Cognitive Friction Limits**: Any psychological processing costs from complex place names are trivial compared to substantive location attributes
3. **Methodological Value**: Testing unconventional hypotheses provides practice with rigorous analytical methods while confirming fundamental patterns

### Future Research Directions

While county name length shows little effect on migration, related questions merit investigation:
- Do complex place names affect **tourism patterns** or **business location decisions**?
- How does **digital search behavior** correlate with toponymic complexity?
- Do **place name simplification campaigns** have measurable economic effects?

### Methodological Lessons

This exercise demonstrates the value of:
- **Applying rigorous methods** to seemingly frivolous questions
- **Testing null hypotheses** to confirm theoretical expectations
- **Using whimsical analyses** as training grounds for serious research skills

Despite its playful nature, this analysis reinforces confidence in fundamental migration patterns while highlighting the overwhelming importance of economic factors in spatial decision-making.
