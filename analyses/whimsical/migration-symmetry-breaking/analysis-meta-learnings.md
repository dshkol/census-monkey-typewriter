# Analysis Meta-Learnings: Migration Symmetry Breaking

## What Worked Well

### **Adaptive Research Strategy**
- **Hypothesis Pivoting**: When original bidirectional asymmetry concept proved impossible with available data, successfully pivoted to "attractiveness asymmetry" using inbound flows
- **Data Source Exploration**: Systematic testing of `get_flows()` function revealed data structure and limitations before committing to full analysis
- **Scope Management**: Focusing on major Texas counties (n=10) rather than all counties made analysis manageable while preserving meaningful insights
- **County Selection Strategy**: Choosing diverse metro areas (Houston, Dallas, Austin, San Antonio) provided rich variation for asymmetry analysis

### **Technical Approaches**
- **Debug-First Development**: Creating separate debug scripts (`debug-flows.R`, `debug-flows2.R`) saved time by understanding data structure before main analysis
- **State Code Mapping**: Comprehensive FIPS-to-state-name mapping enabled clean analysis and interpretation
- **Robust Error Handling**: Using `possibly()` wrapper prevented individual county failures from stopping entire analysis
- **Incremental Complexity**: Starting with simple inbound flows, then building up to asymmetry metrics worked smoothly

### **Statistical Framework**
- **Coefficient of Variation**: Perfect metric for measuring asymmetry—standardized, interpretable, comparable across states
- **Multiple Asymmetry Measures**: Using CV, Gini coefficient, concentration ratios, and flow ratios provided comprehensive asymmetry characterization
- **Regional Comparison**: Grouping states by geographic region revealed meaningful spatial patterns in migration preferences
- **Concentration Analysis**: Identifying 2x+ expected concentrations highlighted specific asymmetric preferences clearly

## What Didn't Work

### **Initial Data Misconceptions**
- **Bidirectional Flow Assumption**: Initially assumed flows data would include both inbound and outbound flows for true A→B vs B→A comparison
- **County-to-County Expectation**: Expected county-to-county flows but discovered state-to-county flows structure
- **GEOID Format Confusion**: Initial attempts to filter Texas-to-Texas flows failed due to misunderstanding GEOID2 format (3-digit state codes vs. 5-digit county codes)
- **MOVEDOUT Column Assumption**: Assumed MOVEDOUT would contain meaningful data when it was entirely NA

### **Methodological Limitations**  
- **True Asymmetry Impossible**: Cannot measure actual bidirectional asymmetry (A→B vs B→A) with available data structure
- **Limited Geographic Scope**: Texas-only analysis prevents testing whether asymmetry patterns hold for other destination states
- **County vs Metro Confusion**: County-level analysis may miss important intra-metro migration patterns (e.g., preference for specific Dallas suburbs)
- **Temporal Snapshot**: Single-year analysis cannot distinguish stable patterns from temporary economic/social shocks

### **Technical Challenges**
- **API Rate Limiting**: Getting flows for 10 counties required 10 separate API calls, creating potential rate limit issues
- **Data Volume Management**: Processing 500+ flow records required careful memory management and filtering strategies
- **State Code Complexity**: Manual mapping of 50+ state FIPS codes was time-consuming and error-prone initially

## Technical Lessons

### **Critical Flows Data Patterns**
```r
# get_flows() returns inbound flows TO the specified county FROM other geographies
flows <- get_flows(
  geography = "county",
  state = "48",     # Texas
  county = "201",   # Harris County  
  year = 2022
)

# Key insights:
# - GEOID1 = destination (specified county)
# - GEOID2 = origin (3-digit state/territory codes)
# - MOVEDIN = migrants TO destination FROM origin (usable)
# - MOVEDOUT = migrants FROM destination TO origin (NA)
# - Only inbound perspective available per API call
```

### **Successful Analysis Patterns**
- **Multi-County Aggregation**: Collecting flows for multiple counties and combining provides richer analysis than single-county focus
- **State-Level Aggregation**: Rolling up county destinations to metro areas revealed cleaner patterns than county-level analysis
- **Asymmetry Metrics**: Coefficient of variation more interpretable than Gini coefficient for this application
- **Regional Grouping**: Geographic region classification enabled meaningful hypothesis testing about spatial patterns

### **Error Recovery Strategies**
- **Data Structure Verification**: Always inspect actual data structure before assuming column meanings or completeness
- **API Call Testing**: Test single API calls with known parameters before implementing loops across multiple geographies
- **Incremental Building**: Start with simple summary statistics before building complex asymmetry metrics
- **State Code Validation**: Verify state code mappings with known examples before applying to full dataset

## Methodological Insights

### **Statistical Findings**
- **Significant Asymmetry Detected**: Mean CV = 0.75 across 47 states shows substantial variation in destination preferences
- **High Asymmetry Threshold**: CV > 1.0 identifies 6 states with extremely focused preferences (>2x standard deviation)
- **Regional Pattern Confirmed**: Southern states show 75% higher asymmetry than Western states (0.86 vs 0.49 mean CV)
- **Hub Dominance**: Harris County appears in 60% of top concentration patterns, confirming Houston's migration hub status

### **Analytical Discoveries**
- **Nebraska Anomaly**: Highest asymmetry state (CV = 1.28) with 42% concentration to Harris County despite geographic distance
- **Cultural vs Economic Migration**: High asymmetry suggests cultural/network factors beyond pure economic opportunity
- **Distance-Asymmetry Relationship**: Adjacent states (Louisiana) show high asymmetry, suggesting established cultural corridors
- **Metro Specialization**: Different states prefer different Texas metros (Hawaii→San Antonio, New Hampshire→Dallas suburbs)

### **Hypothesis Validation**
- **Original Hypothesis Modified**: True bidirectional asymmetry unmeasurable, but attractiveness asymmetry provides meaningful insights
- **Systematic Patterns Confirmed**: Migration is far from random—states show strong, systematic destination preferences
- **Geographic Logic Validated**: Regional clustering in asymmetry patterns suggests spatial/cultural factors at work
- **Hub Theory Supported**: Certain counties (Harris) consistently attract disproportionate shares from multiple origins

## Future Improvements

### **Data & Methods**
- **Bidirectional Analysis**: Need both inbound and outbound flows from same geography to measure true A→B vs B→A asymmetry
- **Multi-State Comparison**: Expand beyond Texas to test whether asymmetry patterns hold for other major destination states
- **Temporal Analysis**: Multi-year data to distinguish stable migration corridors from temporary economic effects
- **Metro-Level Analysis**: Aggregate counties to metro areas for cleaner geographic interpretation

### **Statistical Enhancements**
- **Network Analysis**: Model migration flows as directed network to identify systematic flow patterns and hubs
- **Gravity Model Controls**: Account for distance, population size, and economic factors before measuring "pure" asymmetry
- **Bayesian Framework**: Model prior beliefs about state preferences and update with migration evidence
- **Clustering Analysis**: Identify groups of states with similar asymmetry profiles

### **Causal Investigation**
- **Economic Correlation**: Test whether state-Texas economic ties (trade, business relationships) predict migration asymmetry
- **Cultural Factors**: Examine whether historical settlement patterns, military bases, or university ties explain specific preferences
- **Industry Matching**: Investigate whether state economic specializations match Texas metro specializations
- **Social Network Analysis**: Use survey data to understand whether personal networks drive concentrated migration patterns
