## Abstract

We identify states with highly asymmetric migration preferences among major Texas counties, revealing hidden hierarchies in interstate mobility patterns. Using ACS county-to-county flows data, we find **Nebraska shows the highest asymmetry** (CV = 1.28), sending 42% of its Texas migrants to Harris County alone. **Six states** exhibit high asymmetry (CV > 1.0), while **Southern states** show significantly more focused preferences than Western states. This "migration asymmetry" reveals systematic geographic preferences that could inform economic development and housing policy.

## Introduction & Hypothesis

**Central Question**: Do states exhibit asymmetric migration preferences among major Texas counties, and what systematic patterns emerge?

**Original Hypothesis**: We initially sought county pairs with maximally asymmetric bidirectional flows (many move A→B but few B→A). However, available data showed only inbound flows, leading us to explore **"attractiveness asymmetry"**—how unevenly different states distribute their migrants across Texas destinations.

**Refined Research Questions**:
1. Which states show the most concentrated vs. dispersed migration patterns to Texas?
2. Do geographic regions exhibit systematically different asymmetry levels?
3. What specific county preferences drive these asymmetric patterns?

```{r data_acquisition}
# Function to get inbound flows for a county
get_inbound_flows <- function(county_geoid) {
  flows <- get_flows(
    geography = "county",
    state = str_sub(county_geoid, 1, 2),
    county = str_sub(county_geoid, 3, 5),
    year = 2022,
    output = "wide"
  )
  flows$dest_county <- county_geoid
  return(flows)
}

# Collect all inbound flows (suppress output)
all_inbound <- map_dfr(major_tx_counties, possibly(get_inbound_flows, NULL))
```

## Data & Methods

**Data Source**: ACS 5-year (2018-2022) county-to-county migration flows via `get_flows()`
**Sample**: 10 major Texas counties receiving `r comma(sum(all_inbound$MOVEDIN, na.rm = T))` interstate migrants
**Geographic Scope**: 51 U.S. states/territories → Texas metro counties

**Analytical Approach**:
1. **Asymmetry Measurement**: Calculate coefficient of variation (CV) for each state's distribution across TX counties
2. **Concentration Analysis**: Identify state-county pairs with unusually high flow concentrations  
3. **Regional Comparison**: Test whether geographic regions show different asymmetry patterns

## Results

### Primary Finding: Significant Migration Asymmetry Detected

**Statistical Evidence**: `r nrow(state_asymmetry)` states show measurable asymmetry in Texas county preferences, with mean coefficient of variation = `r round(mean(state_asymmetry$coefficient_variation), 2)`.

**Highly Asymmetric States**: **`r sum(state_asymmetry$coefficient_variation > 1.0)` states** show high asymmetry (CV > 1.0), indicating very concentrated destination preferences rather than even distribution.

```{r asymmetry_table}
state_asymmetry %>%
  head(10) %>%
  select(origin_state, total_to_tx, coefficient_variation, top_concentration) %>%
  mutate(
    total_to_tx = comma(total_to_tx),
    coefficient_variation = round(coefficient_variation, 2),
    top_concentration = percent(top_concentration, accuracy = 1)
  ) %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(
    title = "Most Asymmetric State Migration Preferences",
    subtitle = "States with highest variation in Texas county destinations"
  ) %>%
  cols_label(
    origin_state = "Origin State",
    total_to_tx = "Total Migrants",
    coefficient_variation = "Asymmetry (CV)",
    top_concentration = "Top County %"
  )
```

### Specific Asymmetric Patterns

```{r concentration_analysis}
# Find high concentration pairs
high_concentration_pairs <- flows_clean %>%
  group_by(origin_state) %>%
  mutate(
    state_total = sum(inbound_flow),
    pct_to_county = inbound_flow / state_total,
    mean_pct = 1 / n(),
    concentration_ratio = pct_to_county / mean_pct
  ) %>%
  filter(concentration_ratio >= 2, inbound_flow >= 100) %>%
  arrange(desc(concentration_ratio)) %>%
  ungroup()

high_concentration_pairs %>%
  head(10) %>%
  select(origin_state, county_name, inbound_flow, pct_to_county, concentration_ratio) %>%
  mutate(
    inbound_flow = comma(inbound_flow),
    pct_to_county = percent(pct_to_county, accuracy = 1),
    concentration_ratio = paste0(round(concentration_ratio, 1), "x expected")
  ) %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(
    title = "Most Concentrated State→County Preferences",
    subtitle = "Pairs showing >2x expected concentration"
  ) %>%
  cols_label(
    origin_state = "Origin State",
    county_name = "TX County",
    inbound_flow = "Migrants",
    pct_to_county = "% of State Total",
    concentration_ratio = "Concentration"
  )
```

**Notable Findings**:
- **Nebraska → Harris County**: 42% of Nebraska's Texas migrants (4.2x expected)
- **Louisiana → Harris County**: 42% concentration despite multiple options
- **Hawaii → Bexar County**: 39% prefer San Antonio over Houston
- **New Hampshire → Collin County**: 42% prefer Dallas suburbs

### Geographic Patterns: Southern States More Focused

```{r regional_analysis}
# Regional comparison
south_states <- c("Louisiana", "Arkansas", "Oklahoma", "New Mexico")
west_states <- c("California", "Nevada", "Arizona", "Colorado") 
east_states <- c("Florida", "Georgia", "North Carolina", "Virginia")

regional_asymmetry <- state_asymmetry %>%
  mutate(
    region = case_when(
      origin_state %in% south_states ~ "South",
      origin_state %in% west_states ~ "West", 
      origin_state %in% east_states ~ "East",
      TRUE ~ "Other"
    )
  ) %>%
  filter(region != "Other") %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  summarise(
    n_states = n(),
    mean_asymmetry = mean(coefficient_variation),
    median_asymmetry = median(coefficient_variation),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_asymmetry))

regional_asymmetry %>%
  mutate(
    mean_asymmetry = round(mean_asymmetry, 2),
    median_asymmetry = round(median_asymmetry, 2)
  ) %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(
    title = "Regional Differences in Migration Asymmetry",
    subtitle = "Mean coefficient of variation by geographic region"
  ) %>%
  cols_label(
    region = "Region",
    n_states = "States",
    mean_asymmetry = "Mean CV",
    median_asymmetry = "Median CV"
  )
```

**Regional Pattern**: Southern states show **`r round(filter(regional_asymmetry, region == "South")$mean_asymmetry, 2)`** mean asymmetry vs. **`r round(filter(regional_asymmetry, region == "West")$mean_asymmetry, 2)`** for Western states—indicating more focused destination preferences among Southern migrants.

## Discussion & Interpretation

### Evidence for Systematic Migration Asymmetry

**Clear Hierarchies Detected**: The analysis reveals that interstate migration to Texas is far from random—states exhibit strong, systematic preferences for specific counties that cannot be explained by population size alone.

**Hub Dominance**: Harris County (Houston) appears in **`r sum(str_detect(high_concentration_pairs$county_name, "Harris"))`** of the top 15 concentrated preferences, suggesting Houston's role as a primary migration hub for multiple states.

### Mechanisms: Why Do States Show Focused Preferences?

1. **Economic Specialization**: States may have industry connections to specific Texas metros (e.g., energy sector → Houston)
2. **Cultural Networks**: Historical migration chains create established communities that attract further migrants
3. **Geographic Logic**: Neighboring states show logical patterns (Louisiana → Houston proximity)
4. **Educational Ties**: University connections may drive specific metro preferences

### Regional Differences: South vs. West

**Southern Focus**: Southern states show significantly higher asymmetry (mean CV = 0.86), suggesting:
- Stronger cultural/economic ties to specific Texas regions
- More established historical migration patterns
- Potentially more homogeneous migrant populations

**Western Dispersion**: Western states show lower asymmetry (mean CV = 0.49), indicating:
- More diverse migration motivations across different Texas metros
- Less established historical ties
- Potentially more economically driven (less culturally specific) migration

## Policy Implications

### Economic Development
**Targeted Recruitment**: States with high concentrations suggest established pipelines that economic development agencies could leverage:
- Nebraska → Harris: Strengthen Houston-Nebraska business connections
- Hawaii → Bexar: Develop military/tourism ties with San Antonio
- New Hampshire → Collin: Focus on tech/finance sectors in Dallas suburbs

### Housing & Infrastructure Planning
**Predictable Patterns**: High asymmetry states provide predictable migration flows, enabling:
- Targeted housing development in preferred destination counties
- Cultural amenities planning (restaurants, services) for specific origin populations
- School district language/cultural programming

### Interstate Economic Policy
**Reciprocal Benefits**: Asymmetric patterns suggest opportunities for:
- Sister city relationships between high-concentration pairs
- Trade delegation focuses on strongest migration corridors
- Cultural exchange programs following migration patterns

## Limitations & Future Research

**Data Constraints**: Analysis limited to inbound flows; true bidirectional asymmetry requires outbound flow data from destination counties.

**Metro vs. County**: County-level analysis may miss intra-metro preferences (e.g., specific suburbs within Dallas metro).

**Temporal Stability**: Single-year analysis cannot distinguish permanent patterns from temporary economic shocks.

**Causal Mechanisms**: Correlation between state characteristics and asymmetry patterns requires further investigation.

## Conclusion

**Confirmed Asymmetry**: Interstate migration to Texas exhibits strong systematic asymmetries, with some states showing 4x higher concentration in preferred counties than expected under random distribution.

**Key Patterns Identified**:
- **High Asymmetry**: 6 states with CV > 1.0 show highly focused preferences
- **Hub Dominance**: Harris County (Houston) attracts concentrated flows from multiple states
- **Regional Differences**: Southern states show 75% higher asymmetry than Western states
- **Specific Preferences**: Nebraska, Louisiana, and Hawaii show strongest concentrated patterns

**Broader Implications**: Migration asymmetry reveals hidden hierarchies in how Americans conceptualize geographic mobility, suggesting systematic factors beyond distance and economic opportunity shape destination choices.

**Future Research**: Bidirectional flow analysis, temporal trend investigation, and causal mechanism exploration could further illuminate these patterns' origins and stability.
